# black-and-white-logic

Please implement a basic Othello game with the following features:

- An 8x8 game board, using a light green background for the board and a dark green border around each square
- Round black and white pieces
- Players take turns placing their colored piece on the board
- A piece or row of pieces is captured and flipped when the opponent places pieces on both ends of the row 
- The game automatically detects when a player has no valid moves left. When this happens, the game ends and the player with the most pieces is declared the winner.
- Display the current score (number of pieces for each player) and which player's turn it is
- A "Pass" button that becomes enabled when the current player has no valid moves. Clicking it passes the turn to the other player.
- The game should be fully playable by two players taking turns on the same computer

Use Chakra UI components where appropriate. Don't worry about a start screen, move history, or other extra features yet - let's just focus on the core gameplay for this first version. Thanks!
